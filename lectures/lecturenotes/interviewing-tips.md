## Conducting Good Interviews
The interview process has five steps:
- **A: Preparing** for the interview
- **B: Planning** and scheduling the interview
- **C: Opening and closing** the interview
- **D: Conducting** the interview
- **E: Following up** for clarification

### A. Preparing for the Interview

**Before undertaking an interview:**
 -the analyst should have a good understanding of the organization, its industry setting, and the project's scope and objectives.
 
This involves reviewing: 
- organization reports 
- annual reports 
- long-range planning documents 
- statements of departmental goals 
- existing procedure manuals and 
- systems documentation 
- maybe even your old math or physics text books

Analysts must understand common industry terms and be somewhat familiar with the business problems of the industry.


### B. Planning and Scheduling the Interview. 


- Prepare a list of topics and questions to be covered to help ensure that important points are not overlooked and that the interview follows a logical progression. 

- Schedule interviews from the top down (Heads of departments or sections are usually interviewed before employees who report to them.)


**Interviewers should explain**

- the purpose of the interview
- the general areas to be covered
- the approximate amount of time required



### C. Opening and Closing an Interview

**Opening** an interview:
- introduce yourself
- state the purpose of the interview
- address any concerns raised by the interviewee
- and explain that brief notes will be taken and shared with the interviewee after they have been organized.

Often interviewees are **concerned** that an analyst is trying to **find fault** with the way they work.
One way to set them at ease is to get them to talk about processes with which they are familiar. 
The best interviews are those where the interviewees do most of the talking. Therefore, analysts look for ways to get interviewees to open up to them. 


---

**Closing** the interview
- summarize the areas that have been discussed
- highlight the important facts ... 
... and your understanding of them 
- thank the interviewee for their time
- ask if a shorter follow-up interview can be scheduled at a later date if necessary

This lets the interviewee know that you have been listening carefully during the interview and provides an opportunity for clarifying any misunderstandings. 
During the summary, as well as during the entire interview, the analyst should adopt a posture of **objectivity** and avoid personal comments, observations, or conclusions. 



### D. Conducting the Interview


Use "closed questions" sparingly, as the result of this approach is usually that the interviewees give a brief answer to the question and then waits for the next one, almost as if they were being interrogated by a detective.

**Closed questions (who, where, when, which)**
- set limits on the type, level and amount of information interviewee provides 
- often provide a choice of alternatives 
- can require a bipolar or multiple choice response
- used for clarifying or probing questions or as feedback 
- less time consuming for specific information 
- makes note-taking easier 
- sometimes can get too little information 
- may stop interviewee from volunteering information 
- requires an excellent command of vocabulary and concepts

**Special consideration is to be given to:**
-note taking
-taping
-active listening

**Note taking** can become a distraction if not restricted to brief notations for later elaboration. Your notepad is best kept out of the interviewee's line of vision. 
The purpose of an analyst's notes should be to help recall pertinent points and hypotheses formed during an interview. Many analysts will use broad headings for note taking rather than specific categories. 

**Taping an interview is not always recommended.** 
Taping can intimidate the interviewee; and, listening to the tape and extracting pertinent information is very time consuming. However, video- or audio-taping each have advantages and disadvantages. 
Active listening helps to maintain the information flow and facilitates adequate feedback from analyst to interviewee. 

The **active listening** technique has five key tools: 
- Asking open-ended questions 
- Using appropriate words and phrases 
- Giving acceptance cues 
- Restating the interviewee's responses 
- Using silence effectively 
- When all areas on the interview outline have been explored, ask 
- "Is there anything we've overlooked?" or 
- "What other areas should I have asked you about?" 
- This encourages the interviewee to discuss issues that should have been covered. 
- "What one change would make your job easier or more effective?" 
- This question elicits suggestions for improvement. 
 

**Asking Open-Ended Questions**
- Open-ended questions cannot be answered with a simple yes or no response and thus encourage the interviewee to provide more information. 
- Open-ended questions begin with such words as what, how or tell me rather than such words as can, does, or when. 
For example, "Tell me what happens when a customer calls" 

**Open questions: (what, why, how)** 
- are broad and place few constraints on the interviewee 
- used for determining scope of understanding, response certainty, models used allow expert to express information knowledge engineer does not know about 
- can obtain interviewee's vocabulary, concepts, frames of reference 
- can help with explanations and underlying theory

**Using Appropriate Words and Phrases**
Avoid using words or phrases that are emotionally charged, distracting, or difficult to understand.
For example, emotional expressions such as 
- problem area 
- cumbersome process
- poorly controlled 
imply a foregone conclusion. 

**Distracting statements** contain 
- excessive abbreviations or acronyms
- name dropping
- controversial words and phrases
- colloquialisms
- slang
- jargon. 

**Giving Acceptance Cues** 

People also send messages by:

- tone of voice
- posture
- eye contact
- facial expressions
- body movements. 
  
When used properly, they encourage an interviewee to provide information.
When used poorly, they can have the opposite effect. 
For example, failure to make eye contact in an interview can be interpreted as a lack of interest or concern for the other person. Good eye contact can communicate interest, attention, openness, and a regard for the other person's worth. 

Too much eye contact can be misinterpreted as staring. In our culture eye contact between strangers for more than a brief moment is considered a challenge. In some cultures, eye contact is considered an invasion of privacy. 
Nodding the head to indicate understanding is an acceptance cue, as is a posture of attentiveness: sitting straight and leaning slightly forward. 
Contrast this posture with a person slouching in a chair with one arm flung over the back of the chair or leaning back with both hands folded behind the head. 
**Errors commonly made by inexperienced analysts:**
- Sitting back in a chair with arms folded across the chest.
(This posture implies a lack of openness to what is being said and may also indicate that the analyst is ill at ease.) 


- Looking at objects in the room or staring out the window instead of looking at the interviewee.
(Because this behavior suggests that the analyst would rather be somewhere else doing other things, the interviewee will often cut the interview short.) 
- Taking excessive notes or visually reviewing notes.
(An analyst who records rather than listening may arouse interviewee concerns over what is being written.) 
- Sitting too far away or too close.
(Sitting too far away often communicates that the analyst is intimidated by the interviewee, while sitting too close may communicate an inappropriate level of intimacy and make the interviewee uncomfortable.)
**Acceptance cues are used to convey understanding, not agreement.** 

**Restating the Interviewee's Responses**

Restatement involves repeating something the interviewee has said in the analyst's own words as an indication that effective communication has occurred and that the analyst understands what the interviewee has said. 


Restatement is normally used under the following circumstances: 


- When the interviewee is describing a problem.
(At such times, the analyst's restatement communicates that the interviewee's problem has been heard and understood.) 
- When the analyst wants to check his or her understanding of what has been said.
(This technique is often used in response to complex statements or in group situations where several persons have commented on the same issue.) 
- When the analyst wants to encourage the interviewee.
(Restatement can prompt the interviewee to expand or elaborate on what has been said.)
- Restatement can also overcome emotional barriers set up by interviewees who, for some reason, are uncooperative. 
- The analyst must remain neutral. 
- For example, if the interviewee is critical of management, the analyst should neither agree with the criticism nor attempt to defend management. Instead, the analyst should simply convey that the interviewee's feelings are understood.
- Common errors using restatement: 
- Echoing the interviewee, i.e., repeating exactly what the interviewee has said rather than restating in different words.
(Echoing becomes very obvious after the first few times it occurs and can make the interviewee uncomfortable.)
- Overusing restatement, which can be distracting to the interviewee. 
- Altering or distorting the meaning intended by the interviewee.
(A restatement should be as close to the interviewee's meaning as possible.) 
- Raising the pitch of the voice at the end of a restatement.
(This habit converts a restatement into a question answerable by yes or no instead of an invitation for the interviewee to expand on his or her comments.) 

**Examples of Effective vs. Ineffective Restatements of an Interviewee Response**
Interviewee Response: We continue to sell products to customers who have not paid their bills. 
Effective Restatement: The system processes orders to customers who are bad credit risks.
(Encourages interviewee to expand.) 
Ineffective Restatement: Why don't you check the customer's credit status before processing the order?
(Distorts interviewee's meaning.)
Use silence effectively
at the end of a question to allow the interviewee to collect their thoughts 
after an incomplete answer to encourage the interviewee to continue


### E. Following up for Clarification
After the interview has been documented any clarification can usually be done by using closed questions.
