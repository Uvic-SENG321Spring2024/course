## Syllabus
The official course syllabus is distributed via [HEAT](https://heat.csc.uvic.ca/coview/course/2024011/SENG321) and is our contract for the course. You should read it carefully.

## Operation Details
This class will use Brightspace to post grades and host videos. Class notes and lecture content are hosted here on GitHub. Team discussion are hosted via Teams. 

University and department policies on professional conduct and integrity are applicable. Feel free to see me in person, or via UVic email, for personal questions.

2023 Update: In case it is not clear, using ChatGPT, Copilot, and other LLM-based AI assistants is considered to be a violation of the integrity policy unless specifically mentioned as acceptable in the assignment.

## Project
There is a large project in this course, see project page for a description of its specification, deliverables and timelines. 

## Quizzes
Quizzes will be conducted on Brightspace so please bring something that can connect to the internet on those days.
