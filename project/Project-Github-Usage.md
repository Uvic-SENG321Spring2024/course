# Usage Guidelines
For this project, your team will have write access to two different *repos*.
- one *repo* you will use as the *client* team.
- one *repo* you will use as the *developer* team.

As part of your work as *clients* you will write up and release your RFP in your client repo. Additionally, you will have read access to the developer team repo who will design the solution for your RFP project. You are expected to create an issue in the developer team repo for any problem/question/concern that you encouter when you review their requirements document after each iteration of the project. 

As part of your work as *developers* you will write up and release the requirements document in your developer repo. The client team whose RFP you are responding to will have read access to your developer repo. The client team will review your requirements document after each iteration and create an issue for any problem/question/concern that they see in the requirements document. It will be up to your team to address each issue in the form of a pull request. The requirements document that you iteratively work on throughout the semester will be a single document that each member of your developer team will be expected to contribute. Since it is one md file you will need to coordinate within your team who is going to work on each subsection of the md file. For instance, one team member may work on requirements for feature 1, another team member on feature 2, another team member on software quality requirements, etc. If you encounter some merge conflicts due to conflicting modifications to the same section, you will need to resolve these merge conflicts. Before you can merge your changes to the main branch of the requirements document, it is expected that you submit a pull request for the change and that at least two approvals are submitted before the change may be pushed to the main branch.
