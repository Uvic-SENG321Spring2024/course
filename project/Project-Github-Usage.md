# Usage Guidelines
For this project, your team will have write access to two different *repos*.
- one *repo* you will use as the *client* team.
- one *repo* you will use as the *designer* team.

As part of your work as *clients* you will write up and release your RFP in your client repo. Additionally, you will have read access to the designer team repo who will design the solution for your RFP project. You are expected to create an issue in the designer team repo for any problem/question/concern that you encouter when you review their requirements document after each iteration of the project. 

As part of your work as *designers* you will write up and release the requirements document in your designer repo. The client team whose RFP you are responding to will have read access to your designer repo. The client team will review your requirements document after each iteration and create an issue for any problem/question/concern that they see in the requirements document. It will be up to your team to address each issue in the form of a pull request. Note: each pull request will need at least two approvers before the change may be pushed to the main branch.
