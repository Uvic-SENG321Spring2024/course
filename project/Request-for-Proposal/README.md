Included here are the **RFP template** and **a few examples**. 

The RFP for the **Cowichan Valley Residential Care Project** is an "authentic" RFP document from industry practice and it illustrates example description text for each section in the teamplate. It is way too long for any course project, nonetheless a good example to learn about the contents of each section. 

The RFP for the **Student project** is from a previous SENG321 course and one that was of acceptable quality. Its length is what we would expect in this course. Note that we blocked the actual student names.
