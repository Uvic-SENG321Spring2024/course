## SENG 321 Requirements Engineering Contributions to project Teamwork
### To be completed in a survey (link will be provided prior to deadline) 
#### These reports are not optional. 

Each student is required to create several reports documenting the assessment of each team member of your group,
including yourself. There will be an assessment **after each project iteration.**

Each report should document who did what during the iteration for each person, and your assessment of that person, again,
including yourself. 

Suggested criteria for assessing contribution to the group (client and description) work include:

- communication style
- completion of assigned tasks
- participation in meetings
- contribution to discussion
- reliability of contribution to group work
- attendance in general

Guidance for constructing your feedback: 
- include group number, email, full name, and student number
- each assessment should be one paragraph (roughly) per person in your team, **including yourself**.
- You will be marked on how perceptive, insightful, and reasonable your comment are.
- Provide a **letter grade** per person, alongside your paragraph-long justification.
- Do not give all A+s (or any other grade) for every team member-- this is not appropriate, and is obvious to the teaching team that a lack of effort went into your assessment.
- **Do NOT share your report with anyone. It is confidential**

  **Grading:** the quality of writing in these reports is assessed as 5\% of the overall course grade. Furthermore, the content
  of these reports provide information about each team member's individual contribution to the project and will be used to adjust the overall course grade
  for an underperforming or overperforming team member, to reflect the marking of individual perofrmance as defined in the course outline.
