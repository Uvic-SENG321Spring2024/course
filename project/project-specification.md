# SENG 321 Requirements Engineering Project 

## Objectives
1.	Gain experience with a software requirements specification project by acting as a client for one project and a designer for a different project.
2.	Promote student motivation, professionalism, and self-organization by interacting with real stakeholders.
3.	Apply the RE techniques learned in the course in a group setting focused on realistic problems.
4.	Practice strong interviewing skills with real stakeholders and other student groups.
5.	Improve presentation skills through in-class demos and updates.
6.	Develop strong prototyping skills.

## Context and Management
### Working as a Client
You will work in a 6-8 student project team. Your first task is to find a real organization, introduce yourself, and identify a problem in the company that can benefit from a software solution. You will conduct as many interviews as needed to become familiar with the organization’s system and problem. Subsequently, you will act as representatives of this organization for the duration of this project. Your first deliverable is the request for proposal (RFP), remember the deadline to identify a company is January 17 and the RFP is due January 22!!, so be sure you know enough about the software solution in order to write the RFP. Once you hand-in your RFP, a different team will be assigned to be the corresponding designer team for the problem that is defined in your RFP. As representatives of the problem that can benefit from a software solution, you will act as clients to the designer team for future deliverables. The designer team will then read and understand your RFP and throughout the project will interview the client team three times. During these interviews, you will provide information regarding “your” organization and system. Furthermore, you will provide feedback for the prototypes built by the designer team. As clients, you are also expected to write two additional documents: Requirement Document (RD) 1.1 and Requirements Specification Document (RSD) 1.1, which are explained in further detail in the document specs folder in Connex.

### Working as a Designer
Your team will also act as a consultant contracted to perform requirements engineering activities on a product feature as described by the RFP provided by another client team, which will be assigned to you by the instructor). The ultimate deliverable is a Requirements Specification Document (including high level external design) for the feature chosen by the clients, which will be delivered in stages through Requirements Document (RD) 1.0 and Requirements Specification Document (RSD) 1.0 and 2.0. It is the responsibility of the designer team to independently apply the requirements engineering activities in order to produce the deliverables (RD1.0 and RSD1.0 and RSD2.0). However, the client team is available and expected to clarify questions regarding the solution. Over the course of the project, the designer team will have three meetings with the client team, which provide you the opportunity to elicit requirements, corroborate understanding, and validate and verify prototypes (use case models, UML, sequence diagrams, data flow diagrams, etc). By the end of the project, your team is expected to turn in RSD 2.0, which will be built in three iterations, and give a final project demonstration to the class.


**NOTE:** your project team will act as a **client** for **one** project and a **designer** for a **different** project.

## General Project Rules
1. The project comprises about 80-100 hours per person in the student team.
2. The total effort must be evenly distributed amongst team members.
