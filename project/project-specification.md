# SENG 321 Requirements Engineering Project Specification

## Objectives
1.	Gain experience with developing and maintaining a software requirements specification as a living document in a software project.
2.	Gain experience with the activities and expectations of the roles as clients as well as developers in a software project.
5.	Promote student motivation, professionalism, and self-organization by interacting with real stakeholders.
6.	Apply the RE techniques learned in the course in a team project focused on realistic problems.
7.	Practice interviewing and stakeholder management skills with real stakeholders and other student groups.
8.	Improve project presentation skills through in-class demos and updates.
9.	Develop strong prototyping skills.

## Context and Management

The requirements documentation in a project is a most powerful tool to document the knowledge, expectations and features of a software system. When managed as a living document, it records the understanding of the needs, the business and user requirements, features and non-functional requirements. It is also a record of decisions made through negotiations between clients and developers of the system. For this project you will be working in a 6-8 student project team in both roles of a **Client** and a **Developer** in **two different projects**. Clarification: Your team is the same (but play different roles) in the two projects. 

### Working as a Client


In order to create realistic requirements for a developer team, you, as a client team, must first write an RFP (Request For Proposal). This involves finding a real organization in our community, and gathering a set of requirements based on a problem that they need solved. For example, perhaps a pharmacy in your neighbourhood needs a better system to record which medications have been dispensed. Specific information on how to choose an organization, and create the RFP can be found below. 

To ensure you find realistic requirements, your first task is to find a real organization, introduce yourself, and identify a problem in the company that can benefit from a software solution. You will conduct as many interviews as needed to become familiar with the organization’s system and problem. Subsequently, you will act as representatives of this organization for the duration of this project. Thus, your first deliverable is the request for proposal (RFP), remember the deadline to identify a company is January 17 and the RFP is due January 22! Be sure you know enough about the software solution in order to write the RFP. Once you hand-in your RFP, a different team will be assigned to be the corresponding designer team for the problem that is defined in your RFP. As representatives of the problem that can benefit from a software solution, you will act as clients to the designer team for future deliverables. The designer team will then read and understand your RFP and throughout the project will interview the client team three times. During these interviews, you will provide information regarding “your” organization and system. Furthermore, you will provide feedback for the prototypes built by the designer team. As clients, you are also expected to write two additional documents: Requirement Document (RD) 1.1 and Requirements Specification Document (RSD) 1.1, which are explained in further detail below.


### Working as a Developer
Your team will also act as a consultant contracted to develop a solution to respond to the needs of a client organization (development is not the focus of the project, but performing the requirements engineering activities). The ultimate deliverable is the Requirements Specification Document (including high level external design) for the feature chosen by the clients, which will be delivered in stages through Requirements Document (RD) 1.0 and Requirements Specification Document (RSD) 1.0 and 2.0. It is the responsibility of the designer team to independently apply the requirements engineering activities in order to produce the deliverables (RD1.0 and RSD1.0 and RSD2.0). However, the client team is available and expected to clarify questions regarding the solution. Over the course of the project, the designer team will have three meetings with the client team, which provide you the opportunity to elicit requirements, corroborate understanding, and validate and verify prototypes (use case models, UML, sequence diagrams, data flow diagrams, etc). By the end of the project, your team is expected to turn in RSD 2.0, which will be built in three iterations, and give a final project demonstration to the class.


**NOTE:** your project team will act as a **client** for **one** project and a **designer** for a **different** project.

## General Project Rules
1. The project comprises about 80-100 hours per person in the student team.
2. The total effort must be evenly distributed amongst team members. 

## Deliverables
In this section, the various project deliverables are explained. Material is linked below such that more details can be found in other pages if needed. 

### Request for Proposal (RFP)
#### Guidelines for Choosing Real-World Organizations
As a client team, you will be asked to produce an RFP, which requires you to find an organization with a problem that can be solved with a software solution. Here are some green flags to look for when selecting an organization and problem: 

- The organization demostrates a situation which has a clear need for improvement
- The organization and its problem involve a variety of categories of end-users that are impacted
- The system uses a GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- At least one member of the organization has availability to be interviewed by your team in the first two weeks of the course.

Here are the [guidelines](https://github.com/Uvic-SENG321Spring2024/course/blob/main/project/rfp-instructions.md) including a template for the RFP and the inspection.
